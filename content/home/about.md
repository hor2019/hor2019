# Overview
HOR 2010 is a forum to present work concerning all aspects of higher-order rewriting. The aim is to provide an informal and friendly setting to discuss recent work and work in progress. The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics for the workshop:

- **Applications**: proof checking, theorem proving, generic programming, declarative programming, program transformation, automated termination/confluence tools.
- **Foundations**: pattern matching, unification, strategies, narrowing, termination, syntactic properties, type theory, complexity of derivations.
- **Frameworks**: term rewriting, conditional rewriting, graph rewriting, net rewriting, comparisons of different frameworks.
- **Implementation**: explicit substitution, rewriting tools, compilation techniques.
Semantics: semantics of higher-order rewriting, categorical rewriting, higher-order abstract syntax, games and rewriting
